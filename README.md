Connect

Name: Yenny Purwanto

Purpose: Practice UX testing.

Create a game called Connect.

The Connect game is a two player strategy board game. Players alternate turns. Players may be either an AI or human player. The quality of your AI is not part of the grading for this SRS.

The board starts with alternating squares. A sample starting board is provided in Connect.png. The sample board is for illustrative purposes only and use the colors black and white. You are to create your own board of any style/size/color/etc..

Alternating square are pre-played in the pattern shown in the sample board.

Players may only play in unplayed squares that are in between their own color squares connecting them. This implies the corners are not playable by either player. Once a square is played, it can not be changed for the remainder of the game.

The winner is the first player to either make a connecting loop or to connect opposite ends of the board.

Once your game is written, save a copy of your game as an alpha program. This version will be used as a baseline to compare the final version.

Once your first draft of the app is completed, there will be a second phase of the project that will involve UX testing.

Subsequent revisions must address your UX testing results against the notes taken in the report file (REPORT.md).

Each UX test has 2 phases. The first is silent testing. Your tester must not have seen your app before the test and must use your app without input from you. You need to carefully observe and take notes on what you witness. The tester is encouraged to talk.

After the silent testing, you may interview your tester for your second phase. Use the interview process to complete your understanding of your testers problems during the first phase.

Your grade will be mostly judged on your gathering feedback and incorporating it into your app.
